<h1> What are some specific innovations that engineers are bringing to the response effort?</h1>


<h2><hr><font color="red"face="arial">A: The speed and scale of diagnostic tests for COVID-19 have improved greatly, and engineers have brought artificial intelligence, automation, and process control to industry’s development of those diagnostics. The increase in testing capability is due in great measure to these engineering tools. One important element engineering brings is risk modeling. For example, suppose you’re relying on a certain precursor chemical to make a therapeutic, and there’s a hurricane between you and the source. Do you have a secondary source? Or what happens if you’re making drugs or vaccines, and there’s a three-day moratorium on shipping, or an airport is closed? You have to be able to adjust.

To help do this, some companies are using what’s called a “digital twin” — a computer model of the real world that can help them adjust to the real world. They model systems in the real world — such as the pandemic, or manufacturing processes — which lets them anticipate problems and plan what to do.  The model is continually improved by putting in more real-world data as it emerges.</fonte></hr></h2>
